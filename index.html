<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.</p>
<p>Decide which publishing source you want to use. For more information, see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site."</p>
<p>Create the entry file for your site. GitHub Pages will look for an index.html, index.md, or README.md file as the entry file for your site.</p>
<p>If your publishing source is a branch and folder, the entry file must be at the top level of the source folder on the source branch. For example, if your publishing source is the /docs folder on the main branch, your entry file must be located in the /docs folder on a branch called main.</p>
<p>If your publishing source is a GitHub Actions workflow, the artifact that you deploy must include the entry file at the top level of the artifact. Instead of adding the entry file to your repository, you may choose to have your GitHub Actions workflow generate your entry file when the workflow runs.</p>
<p>Configure your publishing source. For more information, see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site."</p>
<p>Under your repository name, click  Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.</p>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
